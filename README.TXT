PROJECT 9 SAMUEL DAHL
(A mildly dank project I hope.)

STEP 1: FIRE UP THE DATABASE

I have provided the thingy required for you to do this. Its called json-faga.users.json
Enjoy it while it lasts!
Just set the thing up on localhost.
I think thats enough information, but if its not the url should match the DB_URL thing below.

STEP 2: FIRE UP THE BACKEND

  export DB_URL=mongodb://localhost
  export DB_NAME=json-faga

STEP 3: GO TO LOCALHOST:3000/ AND EXPERIENCE GLORY

STEP 4: GRADE MY PROJECT!

STEP 5: HAVE A NICE DAY AND GIVE YOUR CHILDREN HUGS AND TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM!
